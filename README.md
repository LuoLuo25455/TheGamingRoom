# TheGamingRoom
# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
// The client would like me to design a software that is compatable on multiple platforms ranging from computer platforms to mobile platforms. I would like to utilize the singleton strategy to create a specific gaming room for each game with authentication security system added in 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
// The authentication system was well-designed to ensure only authorized personnels with proper credentials can access specific data files

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
// The overall design was like a building game. I started off with designing a singleton program file for each gaming room, then I set up an access point for each gaming room, and then added security on the top of the base program. All of these are finished by logical and thorough thinking and analyzing the client's need

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
// I would like to improve on the singleton part of the project. So far I have only designed one class file. I would like to add more files into it

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
// I analyzed the user's needs from two perspectives: business need and technical viability. In order to keep the program working and thriving, there must be a business need for it. In order to maintain the program, proper techniques need to be implemented

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
// The most useful strategies and techniques I have learned from this project are creating singleton classes and setting up authentication for different users. I believe these skills will be very useful for my future projects
